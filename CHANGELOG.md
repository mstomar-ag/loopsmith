# Changelog

## 0.6.0 — the trust-and-feedback release

The theme: everything the loop CLAIMS is now checkable, everything it produces feeds
back into it, and an unattended night no longer ends at the first limit or crash.
Every new capability ships opt-in and default-OFF (one bug-fix exception, noted);
absent config keys behave exactly as 0.5.0.

### Guardrails made real
- **Prompt gate is repo-scoped** *(the one default-ON change — bug-fix class)*: the
  UserPromptSubmit directive now speaks only in repos that adopted the spine
  (`.sdlc/` exists); everywhere else it is a silent no-op, so a machine-wide install
  never injects policy into unrelated projects. `LOOPSMITH_GATE_GLOBAL=1` restores
  the old always-on behavior.
- **Budgets enforce**: `budget.max_minutes` (wall-clock) and `budget.max_tokens`
  (host-reported via the new `loop.py spend` verb) now actually halt the run;
  previously only `max_iterations` did. Absent keys enforce nothing.
- **Opt-in hard plan-gate**: `gates.hard_plan_gate.enabled` mechanically DENIES a
  source edit unless a fresh plan exists under `.sdlc/plans/`
  (`touch .sdlc/.allow-direct-edits` for a deliberate bypass; fail-open throughout).

### Truthful outcomes
- **`failed` is not `parked`**: a goal the loop could not resolve gets its own
  terminal status, review-queue tag ("needs: a fix" vs "needs: human review"),
  counters, and `record failed` verb — the morning queue separates decide-this
  from fix-this.
- **Machine-checked done**: `loop.py verify` runs the goal's proving command
  (frontmatter `verify_command`, else `verify.command`) and records evidence; with
  `verify.enforce` on, `record done` is REFUSED without a fresh passing verify from
  this run.

### The feedback circle
- **Bidirectional pipeline report card**: declare stages once in `.sdlc/pipeline.json`
  and `pipeline.py card` renders every stage in BOTH directions — forward
  (survivorship: nothing dropped) and reverse (provenance: nothing invented) — with
  uninstrumented lanes reading honest-ABSENT, a typed verdict, and `--compare` for
  the regressed / improved / still-failing (recurrence) delta between runs.
- **Findings become work**: `pipeline.py propose` turns failing card signals into
  `proposed` goal files with the failing check pre-wired as their `verify_command`;
  the loop never runs one until a human promotes it to `pending`.

### Smarter, cheaper, visible
- **Per-step model + effort selection** (under the existing `model_selection: "auto"`
  gate): `resolve-step` returns `model=<tier> effort=<low|medium|high>` so mechanical
  steps inside a hard goal (tests, watchers, lint) run below the goal's ceiling;
  `resolve` output stays backward-compatible.
- **Feature dashboard**: `doctor.py features` (also appended to `/sdlc-doctor`
  output) reports every optional capability's LIVE state with its one-line enable.

### Unattended for real
- **Overnight supervisor**: `scripts/supervise.sh` owns the loop's lifetime with
  zero polling — blocked while a session runs; on exit it classifies the output
  (via the pure `supervise_classify.py`): loop finished → stop · budget → relaunch ·
  usage-limit → **sleep until the stated reset time (+ jitter), then relaunch** ·
  unknown → capped backoff. Kill-file stop; per-run output capture; laptop-sleep
  caveat documented.

57 new tests across the arc (281 total, coverage >85% held, Tier-1 eval baseline
unchanged). No runtime dependencies added.
