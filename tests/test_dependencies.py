"""Companions (superpowers + code-review) are an OPTIONAL enhancement, not hard dependencies.
Every phase they power has a portable sdlc-* executor fallback (see test_packaging_slice4), so the
kit must NOT declare them in plugin.json's `dependencies` array — a declared dependency is hard
(unsatisfied → Claude Code disables the whole plugin with `dependency-unsatisfied`), which is exactly
the install friction the portable executors exist to avoid. This test is the anti-regression guard:
keep companions out of the manifest so `/plugin install loopsmith` is seamless whether or not they're
present. Ref: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-dependencies"""
